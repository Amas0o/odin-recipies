    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This ground beef and cabbage recipe was my mother's. She was a country cook, plain and simple. 
        But as I have traveled and worked and experienced foods from around the world, I look back and realize that many of the dishes she prepared, 
        while simple, were perfect for that moment. Sometimes we have to put emotion and love in a dish to make it extra-special. 
        Serve with corn on the cob and cornbread.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large head cabbage, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
        <li>1 onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cabbage, tomatoes with juice, onion, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper into a Dutch oven or large pot over low heat; 
            cook and stir until it begins to simmer. </li>
        <li>Add lean ground beef on top; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender and ground beef is cooked through, about 45 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
